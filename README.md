- **[`Loins`](https://github.com/glamboyosa/Em/blob/main/loins)**: `Loins` is the Elixir Websocket server responsible for handling the logic of creating unique cryptographically secure keys for our short links as well as custom links.

- **[`Bubba`](https://github.com/glamboyosa/Em/blob/main/bubba)**: `Bubba` is the Express TypeScript REST API responsible for authentication, analytics, payment and most importantly redirection logic for our short links to the intended original link.

- **[`Cupcake`](https://github.com/glamboyosa/Em/blob/main/bubba/cupcake)**: `Cupcake` is the React TypeScript UI. It handles authentication, link creation, analytics, payment and more!

## Future Addons - `Angel`
